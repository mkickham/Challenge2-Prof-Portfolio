# Challenge2-Prof-Portfolio

## Description
In this project, I put together a portfolio that tells prospective companies or interested people a little bit about myself and the work I have done thus far in the WashU Bootcamp. I included a header at the top, complete with nav links that link to my about me section, my github repository page, a resume document on Google Docs as well as a functional "Constact Me" link that opens up email to email me. 

Below that, I included a little blurb about myself and my background, with a picture of me off to the side. 

Below my "About Me" section, I included two image links; one to my Horiseon Challenge 1 project and the second to my GitHub. I plan to eventually replace the GitHub image link with more portfolio's of my work as I progress through this challenge. 

Below those images, I included a footer, complete with nav links to my GitHub page, my LinkedIn profile, and another email link. All nav links on both the header and footer are complete with hover animations.

## Sources

The code for this project was fabircated by me, although I did receive some help from a tutor. The image of the Horiseon challenge is part of a screenshot from my first project, however the code and styling was originally provided by WashU Bootcamp. The image link of the GitHub block was pulled from Kinsta (https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/)
