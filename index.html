                My name is Michael Kickham. I am currently a student in Washington University's coding bootcamp and have only been coding for a few weeks. I have been a teacher the past seven years, teaching high school English and History. My favorite subject to teach is Government. I am a 2014 graduate of the University of Arizona where I earned Bachelor's Degrees in History and Political Science. After that I went on to earn my Master's Degree in Political Science at University of Missouri-St. Louis and began to pursue my Master's in Teaching at Lindenwood University. I've thoroughly enjoyed teaching and I am also enjoying learning a new skill on how to code. Please feel free to navigate the site and explore this portfolio. I have included links to best contact me, so if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out
