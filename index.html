    <p class="about">
        My name is Michale Kickham, I've been working on coding for only a few weeks now, but I've thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I am currently a high school teacher, teaching English and History. I have taught for the past seven years. I am a 2014 graduate of the University of Arizona, where I earned my degrees in History and Political Science. After earning both my degrees I earned a Master's Degree in Political Science from the University of Missouri-St. Louis and then enrolled at Lindenwood University to pursue my Master's in Teaching.
